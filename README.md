## Hi there! Nice to meet you! 🤗

I'm Iván, a Full-Stack Web Developer and a proud graduate of 💛soyHenry. While I possess all the required knowledge for comprehensive development, I have a particular affinity for Front-End work, as it aligns seamlessly with my hobbies!

I genuinely love the IT field 👨‍💻, and I consider myself a proactive and curious individual 💡. I'm passionate about what I do, and I'm eager to continue developing my skills alongside a dynamic and collaborative team.

### ℹ Some facts about me:

💻 I take pride in my diverse portfolio, showcasing a myriad of innovative applications that I invite you to explore. Currently, my creative energy is channeled into crafting a dynamic music player app, a project that fuels my passion for both technology and music. Alongside my development endeavors, I find immense joy in mentoring and guiding almost 100 students as a dedicated programming tutor.

Among my accomplishments are three Single Page Apps (SPAs) born from intensive bootcamp projects, with two already making waves in the digital realm 🚀. The latest addition to my repertoire is a collaborative effort with 8 talented colleagues, utilizing the SCRUM methodology to shape an E-Commerce platform inspired by the essence of a "Personal Art Gallery🎨." Immerse yourself in the experience by exploring the deployed apps at woofizy.vercel.app 🐶 and touristicGate.vercel.app 🚀. Your insights and feedback are invaluable, guiding the ongoing refinement of these creations. For an in-depth exploration of my projects, feel free to peruse my GitHub, conveniently linked at the end of this introduction. 🌐✨

🤩 Besides coding, I'm a big fan of videogames🕹 and movies🎬. In my free time, I indulge in painting and occasionally compose some music🤘!

I hope we can get to know each other better. It was a pleasure to greet you! Feel free to reach out on my social networks for any questions or feedback; your contact would be greatly appreciated.

**Nice to meet you!**

Iván.
