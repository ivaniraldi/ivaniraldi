## Hi there! Nice to meet you! 🤗

I'm Iván, a Full-Stack Web Developer and a proud graduate of 💛soyHenry. While I possess all the required knowledge for comprehensive development, I have a particular affinity for Front-End work, as it aligns seamlessly with my hobbies!

I genuinely love the IT field 👨‍💻, and I consider myself a proactive and curious individual 💡. I'm passionate about what I do, and I'm eager to continue developing my skills alongside a dynamic and collaborative team.

### ℹ Some facts about me:

💻 I've successfully developed three Single Page Apps (SPAs) as bootcamp projects, with two of them already deployed 🚀. One is currently in development, and it's a team effort involving 8 colleagues using the SCRUM methodology to create an E-Commerce platform in the style of a "Personal Art Gallery🎨." Check out the deployed apps at [woofizy.vercel.app](https://woofizy.vercel.app) 🐶 and [touristicGate.vercel.app](https://touristicGate.vercel.app) 🚀. I welcome your feedback, as there are still changes I'd like to make. For more projects, you can explore my GitHub linked at the end of this introduction.

🤩 Besides coding, I'm a big fan of videogames🕹 and movies🎬. In my free time, I indulge in painting and occasionally compose some music🤘!

I hope we can get to know each other better. It was a pleasure to greet you! Feel free to reach out on my social networks for any questions or feedback; your contact would be greatly appreciated.

**Nice to meet you!**

Iván.
