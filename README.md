>Hi! nice to meet youü§ó

I'm Iv√°n, a student of üíõsoyHenry, about to finish the course and obtain the Full-Stack Web Developer certificateüéì. I have all the required knowledge to start when the opportunity arises, although I prefer to work more on the Front-End since complements my Hobbies! I am very excited to have my first IT jobüë®‚Äçüíª, I am a proactive and very curious personüí°, I really like what I do and I would love to develop it together with a good work team.

>‚Ñπ Some facts about me:

``üíªI developed three SPA (Single page App) as bootcamp projects, two deployed üöÄ and one is still in development, since I started with the final project for it, where we are with 8 colleagues using the SCRUM methodology to develop an üí∏E- Commerce in the ‚ÄúPersonal Art Galleryüé®‚Äù style.
The links of these apps are: woofizy.vercel.app üê∂ and touristicGate.vercel.app üöÄ, feel free to leave me your feedback, there are still changes I would like to make. You can check the other projects on my GitHub, I leave the link at the end of this presentation!``

``ü§©I also really like videogamesüïπ and moviesüé¨. I dedicate myself to painting pictures in my free time and sometimes to composing some musicü§ò!
I hope we can get to know each other better, in any case it was a pleasure to greet you, I leave you my networks for any questions you may have, I also hope your contact/feedback, it would be very helpful.``
>>¬°Nice to meet you!

>>Iv√°n.
